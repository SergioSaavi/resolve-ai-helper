## 🚀 What's Next: Your Testing Phase

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   # or: pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Run Basic Tests**
   ```bash
   python tests/test_basic.py
   ```

3. **Test CLI**
   ```bash
   python core/cli.py check-system
   python core/cli.py check-models
   ```

### Building the Executable (Priority 2)

4. **Build Executable**
   ```bash
   python build_exe.py --full
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Clean previous builds
   - Build with PyInstaller
   - Run tests
   - Create distribution package

5. **Verify Build**
   ```bash
   dist\resolve_ai_helper.exe --version
   dist\resolve_ai_helper.exe check-system
   ```

### Resolve Integration Testing (Priority 3)

6. **Install to Resolve**
   - Copy `resolve_scripts/transcribe_timeline.py` to Resolve scripts folder
   - Restart DaVinci Resolve

7. **Test Workflow**
   - Open timeline in Resolve
   - Run Scripts → transcribe_timeline
   - Follow TESTING_GUIDE.md

### Documentation & Polish (Priority 4)

8. **Add Screenshots**
   - UI windows
   - Resolve menu location
   - Results in timeline

9. **Create Demo Video**
   - Screen recording of full workflow
   - Add to README

10. **Update Repository**
    - Create GitHub repo
    - Push code
    - Create first release

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Notes

### Not Yet Fully Tested

1. **Timeline Export**: Framework is ready but export method needs validation with real Resolve
2. **SRT Import**: Import code exists but needs testing with actual subtitle track creation
3. **Long Videos**: Only short videos tested during development
4. **GPU Mode**: CUDA support coded but needs GPU to test
5. **Error Recovery**: Some edge cases may need more robust handling

### Debug Mode Active

The Resolve script has a DEBUG MODE flag that skips actual timeline export for safety during initial testing. You'll need to:

1. Test without actual export first (current state)
2. Once confident, remove DEBUG MODE
3. Implement proper timeline export if needed
4. Test with real video export

### Platform Limitations

- **Windows Only**: Current implementation is Windows-focused
- **DaVinci Resolve API**: Free version limitations worked around but not all tested
- **Model Sizes**: Very large models (large-v3) not yet tested
